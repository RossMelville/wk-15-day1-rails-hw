Ned must find out who killed the previous Hand of the King, Jon Arryn, while trying to protect his family from their rivals the Lannisters. He uncovers the dark secrets about the Lannisters that his predecessor died trying to expose. Meanwhile, in Essos, the exiled Viserys Targaryen, son of the former king, believes he still has the rightful claim to the throne.", image: "GOT.jpeg", programmeID: "gots1"})
